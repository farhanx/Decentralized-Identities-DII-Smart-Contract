# Blockchain Based Decentralized Identities 
A DID is a unique identifier that is globally unique and can be associated with an individual, organization, or thing.

DID stands for Decentralized Identifier. It is a new type of identifier that is designed to enable self-sovereign digital identity. A DID is a unique identifier that is globally unique and can be associated with an individual, organization, or thing.

Unlike traditional identifiers, such as usernames or email addresses, DIDs are not tied to a centralized authority or controlled by a single entity. Instead, DIDs are decentralized and can be managed and controlled by the entity to whom the DID belongs. This means that individuals and organizations have greater control over their own digital identity and can manage their personal information and interactions in a more secure and private manner.

DIDs are typically represented as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can be resolved to obtain information about the associated identity. The DID specification also includes a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) that allows DIDs to be associated with cryptographic keys, enabling secure authentication and message encryption.

DIDs are an important component of decentralized identity systems, where individuals and organizations have control over their digital identity and can selectively disclose information to others without relying on intermediaries or centralized identity providers. This decentralized approach aims to enhance privacy, security, and user control in the digital world.

To test:
1 - Use truffle or Hard hat 
2 - Compile the contract and generate the ABI
3 - Use ABI , Web3.js
4 - Replace the contract address in the html test file.
5 - Run the html under any web server e.g. nodejs server .
